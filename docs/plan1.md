Project Documentation & Development Plan:

The development of this website was initially based on the structure and weekly task breakdown provided by the professor. This plan was very clear and well-structured, and it served as a general guideline for understanding the recommended workflow when building a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, once the practical work began, some steps were adapted or reordered to better suit my personal working process.

At the beginning of the project, during class and with the guidance of the teacher, a Bootstrap template was opened as a starting point. Although this provided an initial structure, I realized that the template was becoming a limitation rather than an advantage. Because I wanted to add more sections and customize the layout of the landing page, working on top of pre-written Bootstrap code caused me confusion between the existing structure and the new code I needed to introduce. For this reason, I decided to step back from the template.

Before continuing with the website’s development on visual studio code, I chose to design the website in Figma. This phase included defining the visual identity, color palette, typographies, layout, images, and the different sections of the portfolio. Designing the website first allowed me to have a clear and detailed vision of the final result, which made the implementation phase more efficient and intentional.

Once the design was finalized, I returned to the development process and followed the teacher’s task structure in a more flexible way. The project repository was set up on GitHub, the file structure was organized, and the HTML was built using semantic elements. The CSS was structured using custom properties for colors and typography, and although the layout wasn’t developed with a mobile-first approach, I was constantly checking this format to make sure the responsiveness was working.

In practice, the project was not developed following a strict weekly schedule. As the work was done during the holiday vacation period, I did not break down the steps or goals by week. Instead, I worked whenever possible, prioritizing having the core code and the overall visual appearance of the website functioning correctly. Once the structure, layout, and lastly, the interactions were in place, I focused on secondary tasks such as writing the README file, refining details, and optimizing assets, including adding images through a CDN.

Not all tasks were followed exactly as outlined in the original timeline. For example, the project license was chosen before the code was fully finished, GSAP was not used for animations, and the README file was completed at the end of the project rather than at the beginning. These decisions were made based on the needs of the project and my own workflow, prioritizing clarity, maintainability, and a smooth development process over strict adherence to the proposed schedule.

Overall, the professor’s plan functioned as a strong organizational reference, while the final workflow reflects a more design-first, flexible, and iterative approach adapted to the context of the project and the way I work.
