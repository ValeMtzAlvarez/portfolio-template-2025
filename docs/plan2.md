The use of AI:

As stated in the README file, Claude.AI was used to implement a typewriter-style animation for the homepage text:
“Hey there, welcome to my digital diary.”

I provided Claude.AI with the existing HTML structure and the JavaScript code I had written up to that point. The prompt used was:

“I have this HTML code (code pasted) and this JavaScript (code pasted). I want the section that reads ‘Hey there, welcome to my digital diary’ to have an animation that looks like a typewriter, as if the text is being written. Please provide the necessary code for this.”
Claude.AI responded with the following JavaScript code:

// =========================
// TYPEWRITER EFFECT
// =========================
const heroTitle = document.querySelector('.hero h1');
const text = heroTitle.textContent;
heroTitle.textContent = '';
heroTitle.style.visibility = 'visible';

let charIndex = 0;

function typeWriter() {
if (charIndex < text.length) {
heroTitle.textContent += text.charAt(charIndex);
charIndex++;
// Typing speed (adjust value in milliseconds)
setTimeout(typeWriter, 80);
}
}
It also suggested adding the following CSS to enhance the effect with a blinking cursor:
.hero h1 {
visibility: hidden; /_ Hide initially until typewriter starts _/
border-right: 2px solid; /_ Cursor effect _/
padding-right: 5px;
white-space: pre-wrap; /_ Preserve line breaks _/
animation: blink-caret 0.75s step-end infinite;
}

/_ Blinking cursor animation _/
@keyframes blink-caret {
from,
to {
border-color: transparent;
}
50% {
border-color: currentColor;
}
}

/_ Optional: remove cursor after typing is complete _/
.hero h1.typing-complete {
border-right: none;
animation: none;
}

After implementing this solution, an issue appeared: the typewriter animation was reading the HTML content literally, ignoring the <br> tag. As a result, the words “to” and “my” appeared together as “tomy”, instead of being displayed correctly as “to my”.
To address this problem, I explained the issue to Claude.AI with the following prompt:
“The text ‘hey there, welcome to my digital diary’ reads as ‘tomy’, which is incorrect. It should read ‘to my’.
Based on this clarification, Claude.AI provided an improved version of the JavaScript code that correctly handles line breaks by converting "<br>" tags into newline characters and re-inserting them during the animation:

// =========================
// TYPEWRITER EFFECT
// =========================
const heroTitle = document.querySelector('.hero h1');
const originalHTML = heroTitle.innerHTML;

// Replace <br> tags with newline characters
const text = originalHTML.replace(/<br\s\*\/?>/gi, '\n');

heroTitle.textContent = '';
heroTitle.style.visibility = 'visible';

let charIndex = 0;

function typeWriter() {
if (charIndex < text.length) {
const char = text.charAt(charIndex);

    if (char === '\n') {
      heroTitle.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));
    } else {
      heroTitle.appendChild(document.createTextNode(char));
    }

    charIndex++;
    // Typing speed (adjust value in milliseconds)
    setTimeout(typeWriter, 80);

}
}

This final solution resolved the spacing issue and ensured the text animation behaved as intended while preserving the original HTML structure.
